## Usage ##

- `unicode <query>` — Search Unicode codepoints by name (or
  hexadecimal codepoint).
    - `⇧` — QuickLook icon of selected codepoint.
    - `↩` or `⇥` — View selected codepoint in various formats (CSS,
      HTML, Python etc.)
        - `↩` or `⌘+C` — Copy selected conversion to Clipboard.
        - `⌘+↩` — Copy selected conversion to Clipboard *and* paste into
          frontmost app.
        - `⌘+L` — Show selected conversion in Alfred's large text view.

### Advanced usage & configuration ###

The icons are generated as needed (and then cached). On a reasonable
system, the workflow can generate &gt; 100 icons/second, but if it's
too slow for you, you can force the creation of all the icons by
entering `unicode wf:genicons` in Alfred's query box or by running
the `icons.py` file in the workflow's root directory. This will take
10–20 minutes, but the workflow will be much more responsive
afterwards.

The icons are generated by the `IconGen` utility in the workflow's root
directory.
